A common pattern in react is to use a reducer to manage complex state, usually when you see reducer code it will look something like this (sourced from the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)):

```ts
const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment':
            return { count: state.count + 1 };
        case 'decrement':
            return { count: state.count - 1 };
        default:
            throw new Error();
    }
}

function Counter() {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    return (
        <>
            Count: {state.count}
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
        </>
    );
}
```

This is a perfectly fine approach and works well a lot of the time, however I think there are a few downsides
to using a switch statement that can be solved by converting the reducer to an object lookup.

-   Extending or overwriting a switch statement is more difficult and verbose than it is when using an object.
-   Typing an object is easier and clearer than attempting to enforce types on a switch statement
-   My personal preference is to avoid the use of switch statements when I can

If you want to just jump straight to the code I have put a full example on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-state-reducer-pattern-wukw3l?file=/src/App.tsx)

Firstly we need to setup some generic types for creating reducers:

```ts
// src/store/types.ts
export type ReducerAction<T extends {}> = Partial<T> & {
    type: string;
};

export type ReducerFunction<T> = (state: T, action: ReducerAction<T>) => T;

export interface ReducerObject<T> {
    [key: string]: ReducerFunction<T>;
}
```

The `ReducerAction` type is used to define the state that we are using. Partial is used here so that when we're running the reducer `dispatch` function `type` is the only required attribute.

The `ReducerFunction` is used to generically define a state mutation.

Then `ReducerObject` is used to define the set of actions used to mutate the state.

As well as these types I have also defined a utility function that takes a `ReducerObject` and returns a reducer that can be passed to `useReducer`.

```ts
// src/store/utils/createReducerFromObject.ts
import { ReducerAction, ReducerObject } from '../types';

export default function createReducerFromObject<T>(reducerObject: ReducerObject<T>) {
    return (state: T, action: ReducerAction<T>) => {
        if (!Object.keys(reducerObject).includes(action.type)) {
            throw new Error(`Unhandled type: ${action.type}`);
        } else {
            return reducerObject[action.type](state, action);
        }
    };
}
```

This utility also has the nice bonus of providing us with a generic error if we dispatch an unhandled action to the reducer.

Now that we have the types and the utility function we can define some state and a reducer. In [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-state-reducer-pattern-wukw3l?file=/src/App.tsx) I have used the example of a counter to keep things simple.

Firstly lets define the state:

```ts
// src/store/counter/state.ts
export interface CounterState {
    count: number;
}

export const defaultCounterState: CounterState = {
    count: 0,
};
```

Then lets define the reducer:

```ts
// src/store/counter/reducer.ts
import { ReducerObject } from '../types';
import { CounterState } from './state';

export const COUNTER_ACTIONS = {
    INCREMENT: 'INCREMENT',
    DECREMENT: 'DECREMENT',
};

export const counterObjectReducer: ReducerObject<CounterState> = {
    [COUNTER_ACTIONS.INCREMENT]: (state, action) => {
        return {
            ...state,
            count: state.count + 1,
        };
    },
    [COUNTER_ACTIONS.DECREMENT]: (state, action) => {
        return {
            ...state,
            count: state.count - 1,
        };
    },
};
```

This setup gives you correct type completion when adding reducer actions and enforces that all your reducer actions are defined correctly.
Also note here the constant `COUNTER_ACTIONS`, I think its a good pattern to setup an object with all your reducer actions in so that you can be sure your always dispatching correctly.

Finally lets use this reducer to manage some state:

```ts
// src/App.tsx
import './styles.css';
import { defaultCounterState } from './store/counter/state';
import { counterObjectReducer, COUNTER_ACTIONS } from './store/counter/reducer';
import createReducerFromObject from './store/utils/createReducerFromObject';
import { useReducer } from 'react';

const counterReducer = createReducerFromObject(counterObjectReducer);

export default function App() {
    const [counterState, counterDispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, defaultCounterState);

    return (
        <div className="App">
            <h1>Counter: {counterState.count}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => counterDispatch({ type: COUNTER_ACTIONS.DECREMENT })}>-</button>
            <button onClick={() => counterDispatch({ type: COUNTER_ACTIONS.INCREMENT })}>+</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

To a define the reducer you pass the counterObjectReducer to the utility function and you get a fully typed reducer.
When accessing counterState or counterDispatch we will get full type completion.

Earlier I mentioned that using an object reducer makes it much easier to overwrite or extend a reducer. Lets say for example we wanted this specific counter to increment +5 each count rather than +1. We can use object spreading to achieve this easily:

```ts
const counterReducer = createReducerFromObject({
    ...counterObjectReducer,
    [COUNTER_ACTIONS.INCREMENT]: (state, action) => {
        return {
            ...state,
            count: state.count + 5,
        };
    },
});
```

I think that this approach to writing reducers is much nicer than the standard approach and will make life much easier when you have complex state that needs to be managed.
